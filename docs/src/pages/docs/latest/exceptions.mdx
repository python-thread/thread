# Exceptions

<Callout type="info">
  Exceptions from Python&apos;s `threading` module are not included. For
  information please refer to Python&apos;s [errors and exceptions
  page](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html).

Don't have the thread library? [See here](./installation) for installing thread

### Suppressing Exceptions

When initializing a thread, you can parse a `suppress_errors` boolean. When a
exception is raised it is stored in the `Thread._errors` attribute. By default this
is set to false.

For ignoring exceptions see [here](#ignoring-exceptions).

```py
from thread import Thread

def bad_function():
  raise RuntimeError('>:cc')

# Suppress exceptions
thread1 = Thread(
  target = bad_function,
  suppress_errors = True
)
thread1.start()
thread1.join()
print(thread1._errors) # list[RuntimeError('>:cc')]
```

### Ignoring Exceptions

When initializing a thread, you can parse a `ignore_errors` sequence. When a exception is
raised it will not be stored within `Thread._errors` or raised. By default this is set as an empty
tuple.

For suppressing exceptions see [here](#suppressing-exceptions).

```py
from thread import Thread

def bad_function():
  raise RuntimeError('>:cc')

# Ignore error
thread2 = Thread(
  target = bad_function,
  ignore_errors = [RuntimeError]
)
thread2.start()
thread2.join()
print(thread2._errors) # list[]
```

### Suppressing and Ignoring Errors

It should be noted that these arguments are not exclusive of each other; you can both suppress and ignore errors.

```py
# Non-ignored error with suppressing
thread4 = Thread(
  target = bad_function,
  ignore_errors = [ValueError],
  suppress_errors = True
)
thread4.start()
thread4.join()
print(thread4._errors) # list[RuntimeError(':<<')]
```

## Exceptions

The list of exceptions that can be thrown accompanied by common ways to resolve the error.

### ThreadErrorBase

This is the base exception class that all exceptions inherit from.

### ThreadStillRunningError

This exception is raised when you attempt to invoke a method that requires the thread to not be running, but the thread is currently running.

> You can wait for the thread to terminate with [**Thread.join()**](.thread-class#methods) before invoking the method<br />
> You can check if the thread is running with [**Thread.is_alive()**](thread-class#methods) before invoking the method

### ThreadNotRunningError

This exception is raised when you attempt to invoke a method that requires the thread to be running, but the thread is currently not running.
This is raised when you attempt to invoke a method which requires the thread to be running, but isn't

> You can run the thread with [**Thread.start()**](thread-class#methods) before invoking the method

### ThreadNotInitializedError

This exception is raised when you attempt to invoke a method that requires the thread to initialized, but the thread is not initialized.

> You can initialize and start the thread with [**Thread.start()**](thread-class#methods) before invoking the method

### HookRuntimeError

This is raised when hooks raise an exception.

This exception conforms to the rules given when a thread is ran with suppressed or ignored arguments.

Example traceback

```text
HookRuntimeError: Encountered runtime errors in hooks

1. my_function
>>>>>>>>>>
/usr/home/proj/main.py:50
ZeroDivisionError:

2. my_otherfunction
