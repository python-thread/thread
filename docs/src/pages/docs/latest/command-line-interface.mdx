We recommend using a packaging manager like `pip` or `poetry`.

<Tabs items={['pip', 'pipx', 'poetry']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```sh
    pip install thread-cli
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>```sh pipx install thread-cli ```</Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```sh
    poetry add thread-cli
    # OR
    poetry install thread-cli
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Building From Source

```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/python-thread/thread-cli

# Install the upstream package
pip install -e .
```

#### Development

```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/python-thread/thread-cli

# Install poetry
pip install poetry

# Install dependencies

```

### Running the CLI

Open your terminal and run:

```sh
thread
```

</Steps>

## Getting started

Try running the help command!

#### Examples

<Tabs items={['Interpreted', 'Imported']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Say you wanted to generate a list of the square of every number from 0 to 999.
    ```sh
    thread process 'lambda x: x**2' '[ i for i in range(1000) ]'
    ```

    This is functionally equivalent to:
    ```py
    import thread

    # Start processing
    worker = thread.ParallelProcessing(
      function = lambda x: x**2,
      dataset = [ i for i in range(1000) ]
    )
    worker.start()
    worker.join()

    # Write output to "./output.json"
    with open('./output.json', 'w') as output:
      output.write(worker.results)
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Say you have a `csv` file at `./dirty_data.csv` and want to parse every line into a `clean` function in `./clean_data.py`.
    ```sh
    thread process 'clean_data:clean' './dirty_data.csv'
    ```

    This is functionally equivalent to:
    ```py
    import thread
    from .clean_data import clean

    # Read files
    with open('./dataset.csv', 'r') as dataset:
      data = dataset.readlines()

    # Starts processing
    worker = thread.ParallelProcessing(
      function = clean,
      dataset = data,
    )
    worker.start()
    worker.join()

    # Writes to "output.json"
    with open('./output.json', 'w') as output:
      output.write(worker.results)
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
